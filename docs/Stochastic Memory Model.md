### Title: *A Unified Theory of Neural Signal Persistence and Memory Consolidation Using Wave Harmonics and Liquid Time-Constant Models*

---

### Abstract

We propose a biologically inspired, mathematically rigorous framework for understanding memory formation, signal persistence, and recurrence in neural networks. Our model integrates wave harmonics for encoding signals with liquid time-constant (LTC) neurons to simulate biological decay dynamics, supporting concepts of time dilation, recurrence, and synaptic strengthening. Drawing on human neurophysiology, our work theorizes that signals encoded as amplitude modulation (AM) within harmonic waves facilitate energy-efficient memory consolidation. We simulate and validate our approach using high-precision numerical methods, demonstrating its potential for understanding phenomena like brain waves, phonological loops, and synaptic plasticity (e.g., STDP). Our findings provide critical mathematical underpinnings and experimental results, paving the way for a Grand Unified Cognitive Equation for signal propagation and memory persistence in artificial neural systems.

### 1. Introduction and Background

#### Problem Statement

Understanding how biological systems maintain signal coherence, consolidate memories, and enable long-term persistence of information remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While traditional models like Boltzmann machines or recurrent networks address aspects of signal propagation, they often fail to capture the energy-efficient, adaptive precision observed in human neural systems.

#### Motivation

Recent experimental results (Lisman & Idiart, 1995; Shouval et al., 2002) suggest that wave harmonics and synaptic processes like Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) play critical roles in neural dynamics. Furthermore, calcium channels and harmonic wave interference appear central to long-term memory formation and refinement.

#### State of the Art

1. **Liquid Time-Constant (LTC) Models**: Effective for modeling time-dependent dynamics and decay in neural cells.
2. **Wave Harmonic Encoding**: Captures signals efficiently through amplitude modulation (AM) with harmonics.
3. **STDP and Synaptic Refinement**: Known mechanisms for signal strengthening and temporal alignment.

#### Key Contributions

- A unified mathematical model for signal persistence using harmonic waves and LTC neurons.
- Derivation of precision-aware recurrence equations for multi-pass signal strengthening.
- Experimental validation showing how harmonic wave interference generates delta-based memory compression.
- Application of these principles to phonological loops and brainwave phenomena.

### 2. Theoretical Framework

#### 2.1 Biological Inspiration

The Purkinje cell’s high arborization (200,000+ fiber inputs) enables efficient AM-based encoding and long-term signal persistence via calcium channels. Brain waves (alpha, beta, delta, theta, and gamma) suggest hierarchical refinement of signals during different brain states (e.g., REM sleep for long-wave persistence).

#### 2.2 Mathematical Foundations

**Signal Persistence Through Harmonics**:
When two waveforms meet—one an input and the other a memory—a delta emerges from their interference:

Over multiple passes, this delta is refined, creating a minimal, energy-efficient representation for storage.

**Liquid Time-Constant Dynamics**:
The LTC model governs the decay and refinement of the signal:

where  controls decay,  governs input influence, and  enables refinement of the signal delta.

#### 2.3 STDP for Synaptic Refinement

Our model integrates STDP to strengthen signals through precise temporal recurrence. For time :

#### 2.2 Mathematical Foundations

**Signal Persistence Through Harmonics**:
When two waveforms meet—one an input and the other a memory—a delta emerges from their interference:

\[
\Delta(t) = \left| A_1 \sin(2\pi f_1 t + \phi_1) - A_2 \sin(2\pi f_2 t + \phi_2) \right|
\]

Over multiple passes, this delta is refined, creating a minimal, energy-efficient representation for storage:

\[
\Delta_{n+1}(t) = \Delta_n(t) \cdot e^{-\alpha t} + \gamma \Delta(t)
\]

**Liquid Time-Constant Dynamics**:
The LTC model governs the decay and refinement of the signal:

\[
\frac{d h(t)}{d t} = -\alpha h(t) + \beta g(x(t)) + \gamma \Delta(t)
\]

where \( \alpha \) controls decay, \( \beta \) governs input influence, and \( \gamma \) enables refinement of the signal delta.

#### 2.3 STDP for Synaptic Refinement

Our model integrates STDP to strengthen signals through precise temporal recurrence. For time \( t \):

\[
\Delta w = \eta e^{-(t_{\text{post}} - t_{\text{pre}})/\tau}
\]

where \( \eta \) is the learning rate and \( \tau \) controls time decay.
