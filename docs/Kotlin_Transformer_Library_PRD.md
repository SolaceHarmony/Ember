# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
The Kotlin Transformer Library is designed to provide a robust and efficient framework for data transformation processes using Kotlin. The library leverages actors and coroutines to ensure high performance, modularity, and scalability. It aims to facilitate the development of data transformation pipelines that can handle various data processing tasks, including text tokenization, embedding generation, and inference.

## Objectives
The main objectives of the Kotlin Transformer Library project are:
- To improve the modularity and flexibility of data transformation processes.
- To enhance the scalability and performance of data processing pipelines.
- To provide a comprehensive set of components and interfaces for building custom data transformation workflows.
- To ensure resilience and observability in data processing tasks.

## Target Audience
The primary users and stakeholders of the Kotlin Transformer Library include:
- Developers who need to build and maintain data transformation pipelines.
- Data scientists who require efficient tools for preprocessing and transforming data.
- Organizations that need scalable and performant data processing solutions.

## Functional Requirements
