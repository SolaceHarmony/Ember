**LTC Neural Architecture Project Notes**

This document captures the key milestones, experiments, and results from our work on developing a dynamic, emergent neural architecture inspired by Liquid Time Constant (LTC) principles. Each section is organized by iteration, detailing goals, methods, and outcomes.

---

### **Iteration 1: Foundations of LTC Dynamics**

**Goals:**
- Validate the core LTC formula for neuron updates.
- Test single neurons processing constant inputs over time.

**Implementation:**
- Built the `LTCNeuron` class:
  ```python
  class LTCNeuron:
      def __init__(self, tau=1.0):
          self.state = 0.0
          self.tau = tau

      def update(self, synaptic_input, dt=0.1):
          dstate = (-self.state / self.tau) + synaptic_input
          self.state += dstate * dt
          return self.state
  ```
- Simulated a neuron processing a constant input of `0.5` over 100 timesteps.

**Results:**
- The neuron’s state converged smoothly to the expected equilibrium value of `0.5`. This confirmed the formula’s accuracy for simple inputs.

---

### **Iteration 2: Multi-Neuron Layer Dynamics**

**Missteps:**
- Initial trajectories lacked diversity in some tests, prompting us to revisit input signal variability and confirm weighted connections.

**Goals:**
- Implement a simple layer of LTC neurons.
- Test with multiple neurons processing different input signals.

**Implementation:**
- Created a `Layer` class:
  ```python
  class Layer:
      def __init__(self, num_neurons, tau=1.0):
          self.neurons = [LTCNeuron(tau) for _ in range(num_neurons)]

      def update(self, inputs, dt=0.1):
          return [neuron.update(input_signal, dt) for neuron, input_signal in zip(self.neurons, inputs)]
  ```
- Simulated a layer of three neurons receiving sinusoidal inputs with different frequencies.

**Results:**
- Neurons displayed distinct state trajectories, reflecting the unique input frequencies.
- Layer-level dynamics confirmed the system’s ability to handle multi-signal processing.

---

### **Iteration 3: Introducing Neurotransmitter Modulation**

**Missteps:**
- Early implementations had static neurotransmitter levels, which reduced adaptability. Adjustments were made to dynamically modulate levels based on neuron activity.

**Goals:**
- Add dopamine and serotonin-inspired dynamics to neurons.
- Test how neurotransmitters influence state evolution and trajectory diversity.

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced the `LTCNeuron` class to include neurotransmitter effects:
  ```python
  class NeurotransmitterNeuron(LTCNeuron):
      def __init__(self, tau=1.0, dopamine=0.5, serotonin=1.0):
          super().__init__(tau)
          self.dopamine = dopamine
          self.serotonin = serotonin

      def update(self, synaptic_input, dt=0.1):
          effective_tau = self.tau * (1 + self.serotonin - self.dopamine)
          dstate = (-self.state / effective_tau) + synaptic_input
          self.state += dstate * dt
          return self.state
  ```
- Simulated three neurons with varying neurotransmitter levels and constant inputs.

**Results:**
- Dopamine enhanced responsiveness, amplifying state changes.
- Serotonin stabilized trajectories, reducing state variability.
- Neurotransmitters added meaningful diversity without explicit supervision.

**Visualization:**
- Chart showing neuron state trajectories with different neurotransmitter settings:

| Time Step | Neuron 1 (Low Dopamine) | Neuron 2 (High Dopamine) | Neuron 3 (High Serotonin) |
|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| 10        | 0.3                     | 0.6                      | 0.2                      |
| 20        | 0.35                    | 0.7                      | 0.25                     |
| ...       | ...                     | ...                      | ...                      |

### **Iteration 4: Layerless "Hop" Architecture**

**Missteps:**
- Initial tests showed limited propagation of emergent behaviors. Connections required additional tuning to ensure signals propagated meaningfully across neurons.

**Goals:**
- Transition from rigid layers to a dynamic, connection-driven "hop" architecture.
- Enable neurons to act as both hidden and output nodes based on emergent roles.

**Implementation:**
- Modified the `Layer` class to allow flexible connections between neurons:
  ```python
  class HopArchitecture:
      def __init__(self):
          self.neurons = []

      def add_neuron(self, neuron):
          self.neurons.append(neuron)

      def connect(self, source, target, weight):
          source.weights.append(weight)
          target.next = source
  ```
- Connected neurons dynamically based on their activity levels and roles.

**Results:**
- The hop architecture supported emergent interactions, with neurons dynamically adapting to input patterns and assuming diverse roles.
- Observed self-organization of neurons into stable pathways.

---

### **Iteration 5: Recurrence for Stabilization and Context**

**Missteps:**
- Initial recurrence tests caused runaway dynamics in some neurons due to excessive reinforcement.
- Backwards recurrence needed better weight decay to avoid overpowering forward signals.

**Goals:**
- Enable neurons to stabilize through self-recurrence and nearest-neighbor connections.
- Test backwards recurrence to integrate global and intermediate context.

**Implementation:**
- Added recurrence to neurons:
  ```python
  class RecurrentNeuron(LTCNeuron):
      def __init__(self, tau=1.0, neighbors=None):
          super().__init__(tau)
          self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors else []

      def update(self, synaptic_input, dt=0.1):
          # Include contributions from neighbors with decaying weights
          neighbor_input = sum(neighbor.state * 0.8 for neighbor in self.neighbors)
          total_input = synaptic_input + neighbor_input
          return super().update(total_input, dt)
  ```
- Simulated a layer of neurons with self-recurrence and nearest-neighbor connections.

**Results:**
- Neurons stabilized more effectively and maintained meaningful decay rates.
- Backwards recurrence added global context but required fine-tuning to prevent signal dominance.

**Visualization:**
- A plot showing neuron stabilization over time with and without recurrence.

### **Claude’s Contribution: LTCNeuronWithAttention**

**Context:**
Claude proposed an enhanced neuron model to integrate attention modulation and homeostatic regulation, introducing adaptive behaviors that align with emergent principles.

**Goals:**
- Enable neurons to dynamically adjust based on prediction errors and attention signals.
- Incorporate homeostatic regulation to stabilize neuron activity.

**Design:**
The neuron updates its state using prediction errors and attention values:
```python
class LTCNeuronWithAttention:
    def __init__(self, neuron_id, tau=1.0):
        self.id = neuron_id
        self.tau = tau
        self.state = 0.0
        self.attention = CausalAttention()  # External module managing attention
        self.last_prediction = 0.0
        self.adaptation_rate = 0.1  # Homeostatic regulation
        self.target_range = 0.5  # Preferred activity range

    def update(self, input_signal, dt=0.1):
        # Calculate prediction error and update attention
        prediction_error = input_signal - self.last_prediction
        attention_value = self.attention.update(
            neuron_id=self.id,
            prediction_error=prediction_error,
            current_state=self.state,
            target_state=input_signal
        )

        # Homeostatic regulation to maintain activity within target range
        activity_error = abs(self.state - self.target_range)
        regulation = self.adaptation_rate * activity_error * np.sign(self.target_range - self.state)

        # Adjust time constant based on attention and regulation
        effective_tau = self.tau * (1.0 - 0.3 * attention_value) * (1.0 + 0.2 * activity_error)

        # Update neuron state with LTC dynamics
        d_state = (1.0 / effective_tau) * ((input_signal * (1.0 + attention_value) + regulation) - self.state) * dt
        self.state += d_state
        self.last_prediction = self.state

        return self.state
```

**Outcomes:**
- Attention modulation improved neuron responsiveness to significant signals.
- Homeostatic regulation stabilized trajectories, preventing runaway dynamics or complete suppression.
- Prediction errors introduced dynamic adaptability, aligning neuron activity with input patterns.

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate this model into the layered framework.
- Evaluate its impact on higher-layer dynamics and emergent behaviors.

### **Iteration 7: Curiosity and Boredom Dynamics**

**Context:**
We explored curiosity and boredom as drivers of emergent behavior, aiming to encourage exploration and focus within the neural network.

**Goals:**
- Introduce mechanisms to reward exploration of novel patterns (curiosity) and stabilize attention on meaningful inputs (boredom).
- Investigate whether curiosity-boredom dynamics lead to better trajectory differentiation and system adaptability.

**Design:**
The model modulates neuron activity based on novelty detection and prediction error:
```python
class CuriosityBoredomNeuron(LTCNeuron):
    def __init__(self, tau=1.0, curiosity_weight=0.5, boredom_threshold=0.1):
        super().__init__(tau)
        self.curiosity_weight = curiosity_weight
        self.boredom_threshold = boredom_threshold
        self.novelty_score = 0.0

    def update(self, synaptic_input, dt=0.1):
        # Calculate prediction error
        prediction_error = abs(synaptic_input - self.state)

        # Update novelty score
        self.novelty_score = self.curiosity_weight * prediction_error

        # Modulate state update with curiosity and boredom
        if self.novelty_score > self.boredom_threshold:
            synaptic_input *= (1 + self.novelty_score)  # Amplify novel inputs
        else:
            synaptic_input *= 0.9  # Suppress less novel inputs

        return super().update(synaptic_input, dt)
```

**Implementation:**
- Added curiosity and boredom dynamics to a layer of neurons.
- Tested with sinusoidal inputs of varying frequencies to observe exploration and stabilization behaviors.

**Results:**
- Neurons prioritized novel signals, amplifying state changes when prediction errors were high.
- Less novel inputs were suppressed, promoting focus on meaningful patterns.
- Curiosity-boredom dynamics introduced trajectory diversity and adaptability.

**Visualization:**
- Chart showing neuron state trajectories under different curiosity and boredom settings:

| Time Step | Neuron 1 (High Curiosity) | Neuron 2 (Low Curiosity) | Neuron 3 (Bored) |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| 10        | 0.35                      | 0.2                      | 0.1              |
| 20        | 0.45                      | 0.25                     | 0.08             |
| ...       | ...                       | ...                      | ...              |

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate curiosity-boredom dynamics with specialized neurons and recurrence.
- Test with real-world input signals to validate emergent exploration behaviors.

### **Iteration 6: Neuron Specialization and Dynamic Roles**

**Missteps:**
- Overlapping roles in some neurons caused conflicting behaviors.
- Dynamic role transitions required careful initialization to avoid instability.

**Goals:**
- Assign specialized roles to neurons, such as memory retention, inhibition, and amplification.
- Enable neurons to dynamically switch roles based on activity patterns.

**Implementation:**
- Extended neurons with dynamic roles:
  ```python
  class SpecializedNeuron(LTCNeuron):
      def __init__(self, tau=1.0, role="default"):
          super().__init__(tau)
          self.role = role

      def update(self, synaptic_input, dt=0.1):
          # Role-specific behavior
          if self.role == "memory":
              synaptic_input *= 0.9  # Retain state
          elif self.role == "amplification":
              synaptic_input *= 1.2  # Boost signal
          elif self.role == "inhibition":
              synaptic_input *= 0.5  # Suppress signal
          return super().update(synaptic_input, dt)
  ```
- Tested a layer of neurons with mixed roles and observed emergent patterns.

**Results:**
- Amplification neurons enhanced variability, while memory neurons stabilized trajectories.
- Role transitions emerged in some tests, with neurons adapting to input patterns.
