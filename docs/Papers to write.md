Papers to write:

Below is an initial “multipass” attempt—meaning I’ll first outline a possible set of papers and abstracts, and then we can refine them as needed. I’ll create a sequence of papers that build logically from foundational concepts to the grand integrated system. Each abstract will stand alone, focusing on the central contribution of that paper. We can adjust, reorder, or expand as you see fit afterward.

Paper 1: Token-Less Harmonic Embeddings for Neural Language Representations

Tentative Title:
From Tokens to Tones: Harmonic Waveform Embeddings as a Continuous Alternative to Discrete Tokens

Abstract (Draft):
Current language models rely heavily on discrete token vocabularies, a design that can limit flexibility and granularity. We introduce a novel method of representing linguistic inputs as continuous harmonic waveforms (“harmonic embeddings”), eliminating the need for a fixed tokenization scheme. Each input dimension is encoded as a combination of amplitude, frequency, and phase parameters, creating rich, waveform-based embeddings that can capture subtle relationships and transitions seamlessly. We demonstrate that these harmonic embeddings, trained to approximate transformer-derived embeddings, can represent semantic nuances without relying on discrete tokens. In preliminary experiments on synthetic language tasks, our method achieves comparable or superior semantic alignment to traditional embeddings. This approach lays a foundation for more fluid language models that integrate continuous-time and frequency-domain representations.

Paper 2: Integrating Liquid Time-Constant (LTC) Dynamics into Transformer Architectures

Tentative Title:
Continuous-Time Reasoning: Infusing LTC Neurons into Transformer-Based Models

Abstract (Draft):
Transformer architectures excel at parallel pattern processing but lack inherent mechanisms to handle continuous-time adaptation and memory retention. We present a hybrid framework that embeds Liquid Time-Constant (LTC) neurons into transformer layers, yielding a model that can adapt representations over time and maintain stable attractors. By applying LTC-based state updates at each timestep, the model blends transformer attention’s pattern recognition with LTC’s continuous-time dynamics. On temporal prediction benchmarks, this hybrid approach outperforms pure transformers and LSTM baselines, showing improved handling of longer contexts and time-sensitive patterns. This integration offers a route to models that reason fluidly over continuous signals, bridging the gap between discrete sequence models and dynamical systems.

Paper 3: Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) for Causal Credit Assignment in LTC-Transformer Hybrids

Tentative Title:
STDP-Driven Synaptic Adaptation in Continuous-Time Neural Language Models

Abstract (Draft):
We propose a method to incorporate Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) into a hybrid LTC-Transformer model, enabling biologically inspired causal credit assignment. By extending the model’s state space to include synaptic weights that evolve according to spike timings, we allow the network to refine its internal connectivity and strengthen or weaken causal pathways over time. In controlled experiments on synthetic language tasks where causality and temporal order matter, STDP-based adaptation leads to more stable long-term recall and improves error recovery after ambiguous inputs. Our results confirm that incorporating STDP yields models that not only predict sequences but also internalize causal structures, paving the way for more human-like learning dynamics.

Paper 4: Neuromodulatory Precision Scaling in Continuous-Time Cognitive Architectures

Tentative Title:
Precision on Demand: Neuromodulatory Control of Numerical Stability and Memory Depth

Abstract (Draft):
As models grow complex and handle long contexts, minor numerical errors can propagate, distorting long-term memories. We introduce a neuromodulatory-inspired mechanism for dynamically adjusting the arithmetic precision of LTC-based computations. This “precision gradient” mimics neurochemical states that enhance or relax calculation accuracy where needed, allowing subtle attractors and temporal correlations to remain stable. Tests on tasks involving delicate temporal cues show that adaptive precision outperforms fixed-precision arithmetic and stochastic rounding methods. This paper demonstrates that targeted precision scaling can stabilize deep memory traces, bridging computational efficiency and biological plausibility.

Paper 5: Virtual Retinas: Geometric Feature Extraction and Pattern Matching from Raw Inputs

Tentative Title:
Virtual Retinas: Geometric Preprocessing for Letter-to-Neuron Mappings in Continuous-Time Systems

Abstract (Draft):
We present a “virtual retina” module that takes raw character inputs and projects them onto spatially defined geometric windows, enabling a direct mapping of letters to neural units representing fibers or dendritic segments. By preprocessing textual data as 2D patterns (e.g., letter shapes or positions), we feed continuous, topological information into our LTC-Transformer hybrid. Initial experiments on character-level language tasks show improved robustness and spatial-feature extraction, laying a foundation for hierarchical and sensory-like processing layers. This approach can be seen as emulating early visual cortex stages, leading to richer representations before linguistic modeling begins.

Paper 6: Path Integral Formalism for Unified Cognitive Computation

Tentative Title:
Beyond Determinism and Stochasticity: A Path Integral Framework for Neural Cognition

Abstract (Draft):
We propose a path integral (functional integral) formalism that unifies deterministic LTC equations, probabilistic exploration, STDP-driven plasticity, and harmonic embeddings into a single mathematical entity. By defining an action functional that weights entire trajectories of neural states and synaptic configurations, we naturally incorporate causality, hierarchical constraints, and time-dependent adaptation. This formalism aligns with known principles in physics, providing a robust theoretical substrate that handles complexity gracefully. We show how small examples can be explained via action minimization and Boltzmann-weighted trajectory sampling, illustrating how all previously introduced components—LTC, STDP, neuromodulatory precision, harmonic embeddings—fit into one coherent framework.

Paper 7: The Grand Unified Cognitive Equation (G.U.C.E.) and Tool-Driven Exploration

Tentative Title:
Assembling the Cognitive Machine: G.U.C.E., Tool Integration, and Active World Models

Abstract (Draft):
Finally, we integrate all previous components—harmonic embeddings, LTC-Transformer hybrids, STDP plasticity, neuromodulatory precision, virtual retinas, and the path integral approach—into a single conceptual blueprint: the Grand Unified Cognitive Equation (G.U.C.E.). We describe how an agent equipped with virtual “motor neurons” can invoke external tools (e.g., file I/O, indexing services) to actively query knowledge bases. This agent navigates embeddings as if reading a dynamic “book,” learning from causal feedback signals and adjusting synapses over time. Preliminary simulations with synthetic corpora show the system identifying knowledge gaps, engaging in directed learning, and dynamically balancing exploration and exploitation. The G.U.C.E. framework suggests a pathway toward genuinely cognitive AI systems capable of continuously refining their internal world models, guided by principles drawn from both neuroscience and physics.

This is the initial “menu” of papers, each with a rough abstract outlining its core contributions. We can refine, reorder, or combine some as needed, depending on which components you wish to emphasize first.
